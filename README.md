# pythonProject6

The main code is written in the file name 'mainfile.py'
I tried to generate a plot which would have been saved in the 'tree.dot' file but that has not been currently successful but would work on it further
the 'logfile.log' contains the loggings that were done. 
'test.csv' was the initial test file
'train.use.csv' was the training dataset.
There are two dataset because that was what I got from Kaggel but I concatenated them into work which i worked with. 
Also, there were some of the codes that I blocked out becuase it takes too long to run so you can unblock those codes and test them out 
(especially those for the classes for preprocessing etc.
This is the link for acessing the testing dataset used: https://github.com/findelisting/pythonProject6/blob/master/test.csv
